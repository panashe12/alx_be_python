# Define the given variables
principal = 1000      # Principal amount ($1000)
rate = 0.05           # Annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3              # Time in years (3 years)

# Calculate simple interest using the formula I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
